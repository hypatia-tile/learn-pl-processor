# objectives/

This directory defines concrete targets, milestones, and end goals.

Examples:
- a list of skills I want to master
- competency trees (parsing, semantics, compilers, etc.)
- milestones toward building a complete language processor
- monthly or quarterly goal summaries

Objectives should be more stable than daily notes or plans.
The express *what* I want to achieve, not *how*.

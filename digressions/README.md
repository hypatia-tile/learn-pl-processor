# digressions/

This directory stores important topics that are *not* directly part of programming language processors, but contribute to my foundational understanding.

Examples:
- mathematics (algebra, category theory, logic)
- operating system concepts
- computer architecture and hardware notes
- networking basics
- containerization, virtualization, compilers toolchains

Digressions help maintain a clean main workflow while still capturing crutial background knowledge.

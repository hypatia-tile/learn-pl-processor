# planning/

This directory contains high-level plans for the project.

These documents define direction, scope, and the sequence of what I want to learn or build.
Example include:

- quarterly or monthly plans
- learning roadmaps
- sequencing of topics (parsing → semantics → IR → codegen)

Planning documents should remain concise and mostly forward-looking.

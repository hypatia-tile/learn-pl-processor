# experiments/

This directory stores small, focused implementations and prototypes.

Examples:
- a tiny parser or lexer
- a simple bytecode VM
- experimetal DSLs (Ruby DSL, arithmetic DSL, etc.)
- micro compilers or interpreters

Experiments do not need to be perfect.
The serve as working laboratories for understanding how programming languages function.

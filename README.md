# learn-pl-processor

The goal of this project is to become proficient in **Programming Language Processors**,
with theoretical and practical knowledge of them and the ability to leverage this knowledge.

## Definition

We will define the term **Programming language processor** as any entity that takes code and executes or transforms it.

## Repository Structure

```sh
planning/ # high-level plans and roadmaps
experiments/ # prototypes, implementations, and small research programs
notebooks/ # daily notes, theory notes, and informal documentation
conversations/ # distilled insights from ChatGPT, GitHub Discussions, etc.
objectives/ # milestones, skill targes, end goals
publish/ # polished and coherent documents ("READY")
digressions/ # important but indirect topics (OS, math, architecture...)
terminologies/ # glossary of concepts related to PL and computing
```

## Workflow

1. Create or update plans in `planning/`.
2. Explore ideas and build prototypes in `experiments/`.
3. Record learning, theory, and reflections in `notebooks/`.
4. Summarize external conversations in `conversations`.
5. Turn learnings into actionable items in `objectives/`.
6. Move stable, polished results into `publish/`.

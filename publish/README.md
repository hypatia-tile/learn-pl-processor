# poblish/

This directory is for polished, coherent documents that represent stable knowledge or finished work.

Examples:
- clearnly written articles on parsing or semantics
- structured reports on completed experiments
- architecture diagrams
- curated summaries of multiple notebook experiments

This is effectively the "READY" stage of the workflow.

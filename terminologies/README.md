# terminologies/

This directory contains a personal glossary of terms used throughout this repository.
Terms are stored in lightweight Markdown files, usually one per concept.

Structure:

```go
terminologies/
├── by_name/
├   └── abs.md # abstract syntax tree
├   ├── ope.md # operator-overloading.md
├   ├── den.md
├   ├── dir.md
├   └── lam.md
└── by_topic/
    ├── semantics/
    ├── parsing/
    ├── type-theory/
    └── compilers/
```

Each term should define:
- definitaion
- key properties
- examples
- related concepts
- references

This directory serves as a durable reference for future study and writing.
